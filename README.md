# Public API Requests

## Objective

Build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

**API**: [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me)

## Extra Credit

These are additional features I added to the project for extra credit:

- Add a search feature to filter employees by name
- Add a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open
- Edit CSS:
  - Updated the font to `Roboto Mono`
  - Updated `.card`'s `overflow` property to `auto` after noticing some emails not fitting into the card properly
